### **_Getting Started_**

##### The player enters the game opposite the dealer. A standard 52-card pack is used. The player is dealt 2 cards and given the option to hit (be dealt another card) or stay and the dealer takes their turn. Whoever's cards add up closer to 21, without exceeding 21 wins. After a winner is declared, the deck reshuffles and the player can decide again whether to hit or stay.
